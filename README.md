## Arithemanía 2.0

Arithemania, Shunya's signature event and the first-ever 30-hour hackathon based on applied mathematics and its applications, has been a smash hit in the past. The hackathon provides students with a unique opportunity to explore exciting domains such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, numerical analysis, cryptography, cybersecurity, image processing, and other cutting-edge areas of study. It's a one-of-a-kind platform for students to connect with like-minded peers, broaden their horizons, and discover new opportunities.

Last year's Arithemania was a huge success, with over 500 registrations and 25+ teams participating from diverse backgrounds. Participants had the chance to showcase their creativity, critical thinking, and technical abilities. Building on that success, we're thrilled to announce the launch of Arithemania 2.0!

This year's edition of Arithemania is going to be bigger, better, and more exciting than ever before! Join us at PESU 52 of PES University on April 7th and 8th for an unforgettable hackathon experience. You'll have the opportunity to network, innovate, and learn from the most talented individuals and industry experts in their respective fields. Get ready to take on new challenges, make new friends, and hack your way to success with Arithemania 2.0!
